# stdinbot

A stupidly simple IRC bot to interact with stdin.

# miniirc

A simple IRC client framework.

The miniirc framework is now on a [separate repo](/luk3yx/miniirc), and can be
installed via pip with `sudo -H pip3 install miniirc`.

Eventually, the `miniirc.py` file in this repo will disappear entirely.
